##Introduction

Diversity in Tech is a website that provides a central resource, for information, and an open forum about diversity in tech with an emphasis on gender, race, and ethnicity.

In early 2015 major tech companies publicly released their annual diversity reports. Companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon all showed their reports. Reports showed an overwhelming lack of diversity in these major companies mainly in the area of gender and race and ethnicity. It is evident that there’s a huge divide in the today’s technology field.  

##Issues 
collecting data from reliable sources and compelling them into user friend info graphs
other sites have reported on the issue
there’s an overwhelming amount of data to go through 
Which companies/sources do I use for this projects

##Goals

Building a collaborative website. Collaboration leads to new ideas and possible solutions 
Sharing information. Information sharing could lead to people being exposed to the important issue
Provide resources for those who’ve been victims of discrimination in the workplace, this website could provide detailed resources for those in need of it.
Igniting public interest could lead to more discussions and even possible solutions to not only the diversity in tech, but in other industries as well

Audience: People interested getting into tech, people already establish in the tech community, tech employers, people who’ve been discriminated against in the work place, lawyers, and activist.

Competitive market study: Major online tech and non-tech websites :
CNET - Major online technology site that tracks all the latest consumer technology breakthroughs. CNET recently share an article CNET would be a competitor because they’re a trusted source for breaking technology news. http://www.cnet.com/news/going-beyond-lip-service/. 

NPR - NPR stand for National Public Radio. They’re a privately and publicly funded non-profit membership media organization. They have a network of 900 public radio stations in the united states. NPR would be a major competior, because they’re a trusted news source and are well established.  They recently released on article discussing the issue of diversity in tech.http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/07/26/426364306/more-than-a-pipeline-problem-in-search-of-diversity-in-silicon-valley

The Verge -  The Verge was founded in 2011, they cover topics such as technology, science, art, and culture. They specialize in reporting long form feature stores, breaking new covers, product information, and community content. The Verge is considered a competitor because they’re a trusted news outlet for technology based news. The Verge recently released a article about the topic  http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/26/8850939/facebooks-diversity-report-race-gender-jobs

Mashable -  Mashable is a leading global media company that informs, inspires and entertains. Mashable has a dedicated audience of 42 million monthly unique visitors and 24 million social network followers. I believe Mashable’s enormous user base is reason enough for considering them a fellow competitor. Mashable recently released a article quoting Tim Cook’s ( Apple CEO) view on the issue. http://mashable.com/2015/06/08/tim-cook-apple-diversity-women-future/

USA today - Founded in 1982, USA today is a multi-platorm new outlet. USA today has been a trusted source of today’s new and is a established source of today’s news.  USA recently released an article about diversity in tech.

##Game plan


Diversity in Tech.org is a non-profit website that will provide information, resources, and assistance for those who are interested in the topic of diversity in tech mainly for gender, race, and ethnicity. 


For the home page I'm considering providing a couple of Javascript or JQuery infographic charts that details the disparities in tech (mainly gender, race, and ethnicity), these charts will allow users to interactive with current data and help provide understanding of the issue. I will also provide captions to these infographics and describe why they’re important . I will also provide a general write up on the home page describing the harmful effects of the lack of diversity in a work environment, possible causes for the divide, and possible solutions.
 


Next, a resource page will provide news articles, rights for individuals who’ve been victims of discrimination in the work place, and a FAQ section.  I would provide an active feed articles that will provide current information on the topic. For individuals who’ve been victims of discrimination in the work place. Links to the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), A template could be provided to help users with getting started in contacting their local EEOC. 


Lastly, a forum will provide a platform for users to share their personal stories, ask questions, seek one on one assistance, share possible solutions, and provide an open communication between members.
